# warp: Group Dates

Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods including: yearly,
monthly, by second, by week of the month, and more. The groups are
defined in such a way that they also represent the distance between
dates in terms of the period. This extracts valuable information that
can be used in further calculations that rely on a specific temporal
spacing between observations.
